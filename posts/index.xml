      <description>In this post I’ll use some of the information made public by VirusTotal in a recent blog post and show how you can easily create a Metasploit Meterpreter payload and append it to a signed MSI file. This will allow you to leverage the code signing from the MSI file to make your payload appear legitimately signed by Google, Inc. After I’ll cover a bit of discussion on why this technique is dangerously significant and how to investigate for its use.</description>

      <description>At SANSFIRE 2018 in Washington, DC I had the awesome opportunity to compete in SANS DFIR NetWars with a coworker from Red Canary. This was my first experience with NetWars, and I wasn’t sure what to expect with the tournament. We heard that at SANSFIRE DFIR NetWars would allow team competition this time around, which is different from the previous individual-only competition. I went to a SANS@Night session titled “Intro to NetWars” given by Tim Medin of Red Siege Infosec fame with my coworker and our experience soon turned into a recruiting effort.</description>
