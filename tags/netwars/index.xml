      <description>At SANSFIRE 2018 in Washington, DC I had the awesome opportunity to compete in SANS DFIR NetWars with a coworker from Red Canary. This was my first experience with NetWars, and I wasn’t sure what to expect with the tournament. We heard that at SANSFIRE DFIR NetWars would allow team competition this time around, which is different from the previous individual-only competition. I went to a SANS@Night session titled “Intro to NetWars” given by Tim Medin of Red Siege Infosec fame with my coworker and our experience soon turned into a recruiting effort.</description>
