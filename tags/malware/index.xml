      <description>A colleague asked me a question today about the relationship between Qbot and a Windows system utility: esentutl.exe. Itâ€™s been sparsely documented via tweet, and I want to more fully explain why Qbot jumped into using the utility during operations.
The WebCache Qbot is a banking trojan, so its operators are naturally interested in obtaining data from victim hosts. The data includes internet browsing history, files opened, and much more. This data now lives within the WebCacheV01.</description>
