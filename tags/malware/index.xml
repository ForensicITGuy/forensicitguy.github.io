      <description>Command and control (C2) frameworks often support multiple platforms, and PowerShell Empire is no different. In older days, there was a Python Empyre version that eventually merged into the full Empire project and support for macOS and Linux systems still exists within Empire. For these platforms, Empire leverages python-based launchers to execute commands. While the Python launchers may be platform independent, adversaries must still deliver them to victim hosts. This delivery presents an excellent opportunity for detection and analysis.</description>

      <title>How Qbot Uses Esentutl</title>

      <description>A colleague asked me a question today about the relationship between Qbot and a Windows system utility: esentutl.exe. Itâ€™s been sparsely documented via tweet, and I want to more fully explain why Qbot jumped into using the utility during operations.
The WebCache Qbot is a banking trojan, so its operators are naturally interested in obtaining data from victim hosts. The data includes internet browsing history, files opened, and much more. This data now lives within the WebCacheV01.</description>
