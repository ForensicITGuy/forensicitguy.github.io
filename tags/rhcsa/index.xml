      <description>Bourne-compatible Unix shells (bash, sh, etc.) usually include capabilities to redirect input and output in the shell. One of the basic objectives of RHCSA 8 is to learn how to manipulate input and output, and since I work in security I wanted to put a spin on the content to show how adversaries may use I/O redirection to stump defenders. If you already know about I/O redirection and you&amp;rsquo;re just here for the security stuff, jump forward here.</description>

Choosing my educational goal for the year always causes a bit of anxiety. I try to find the right balance between something that is fun to learn and something that will help with my day job. Last year, the educational goal was to learn Volatility memory forensics better through a training class.</description>
