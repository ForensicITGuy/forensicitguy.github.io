      <title>Linux EDR Evasion With Meterpreter and LD_PRELOAD</title>

      <description>Everyone has their favorite adversary technique to research and mine is LD_PRELOAD process injection because it&#39;s pretty versatile. It lets you hook functions to manipulate output, and it can also let you trip up defenders by injecting code into arbitrary processes for execution. In this post, I&#39;ll walk through how an adversary might combine Meterpreter with LD_PRELOAD to hide malicious activity under a legitimate Linux system process.
The Setup To get started, I&#39;m working with a Kali Linux machine as my attacker system and a CentOS 8 system as my victim.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Yum and DNF Plugins for Persistence</title>

      <description>Two Metasploit Framework modules have held my interest in the last few weeks: the ones for persistence using Linux package managers apt and Yum. While they require root privileges to exploit, they provide a novel persistence mechanism that is likely overlooked by defenders. While looking at these modules I noticed that persistence using DNF wasn’t included, and I set off to find a way to persist on Linux systems using DNF plugins.</description>

      <description>Updated 2020-01-04 - Added the Red Hat Certs Slack group to the community list and lab environment to the lab list.
Choosing my educational goal for the year always causes a bit of anxiety. I try to find the right balance between something that is fun to learn and something that will help with my day job. Last year, the educational goal was to learn Volatility memory forensics better through a training class.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been around the Linux/BSD/Solaris/Other UNIX ecosystem for a while you’ve probably heard of the fabled LD_PRELOAD trick. If you haven’t heard of it, let me introduce you to one of the longest-held, dirty security issues in UNIX…
A Brief Look at LD_PRELOAD LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable used by the dynamic linker on UNIX-based systems. Normally the dynamic linker follows a specified search pattern to load various dynamic libraries (shared objects on UNIX).</description>
